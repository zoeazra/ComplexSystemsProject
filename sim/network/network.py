    Simulates a dynamic network model with time steps, where nodes represent satellites or debris, 
    and edges represent potential collisions. The network evolves through collisions and satellite launches.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    G : networkx.Graph
        The initial network graph, where nodes represent satellites or debris.

    iterations : int
        The number of simulation steps to run.

    P : float
        The probability of a collision occurring between two nodes in the network.

    plow : float
        The probability that a collision generates a new fragment (debris).

    new_fragments_per_collision : int
        The number of new fragments generated per collision when plow is satisfied.

    nr_sat_launches : int
        The number of new satellites introduced into the system at each launch event.

    launch_freq : int
        The frequency (in time steps) at which new satellites are launched.

    Returns:
    --------
    avg_degrees : list of float
        A list of average node degrees over the simulation time steps.

    gc_proportions : list of float
        A list of proportions of the largest connected component (GC) relative to the total number of nodes.

    satellites_launched : list of int
        A list tracking the cumulative number of satellites launched at each time step.

    Notes:
    ------
    - If the number of nodes exceeds 3000, the simulation stops early to prevent excessive computational load.
    - Collisions are sampled based on probability `P`, and new fragments may be generated.
    - A record of the system's evolution is saved to the `results` directory using the `write` function.
    - New satellites are launched periodically according to `launch_freq`.
